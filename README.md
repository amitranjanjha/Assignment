## App Architecture: Key Components and Data Flow

Description below outlines the key components and data flow within this application's architecture, emphasizing a clear separation of concerns for improved maintainability and testability.

## Key Components and Their Roles
### Presentation Layer (View):

     **UserListScreen (Composable)** Displays list of users using Jetpack Compose and handles UI interactions.
     **ViewModel** Manages UI-related data and state, processes user actions, and communicates with the domain Layer.
     **DispatcherProvider** Provides coroutine dispatchers (IO, Main, Default) to decouple threading from logic.

### Domain Layer:
    **User** Represents a business model containing user information (id, name, email, etc.).
    **UserListRepository** Defines the contract for fetching user-related data, abstracting data sources.
    **GetUserListUseCase** Encapsulates the business logic to retrieve the user list from the repository.
    
### Data Layer :
    **NetworkService** Retrofit interface defining API endpoints for user data.
    **UserListRepositoryImpl** Concrete implementation of UserListRepository, fetching users from NetworkService.
    **ApiModule** Hilt module providing network dependencies like Retrofit and API interfaces.
        
### Util:
    General Item
    
## Data Flow
Understanding the data flow illustrates how different components interact to deliver information to the user:

    1. User : User open the screen
    2. UI Notification: The UI notifies the ViewModel for data.
    3. ViewModel Request: The ViewModel requests data from the Repository thru usecase.
    4. Repository Fetch: The Repository fetches data from the NetworkService.
    5. NetworkService API Call: The NetworkService makes an API call to the External API.
    6. Data Flow Back: Data flows back up the chain, potentially undergoing transformations at each layer to fit the needs of the higher layers.
    7. ViewModel Update: The ViewModel updates its state with the received data.
    8. UI Update: The UI observes the ViewModel's state changes and updates accordingly to display the new information to the user.

## TODO
Add more test cases especially Android instrumentation tests.  
Add Room Database to support offline first app.
